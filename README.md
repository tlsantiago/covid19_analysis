COVID-19 evaluation focused on Brazil.

The main idea of this project is evaluating data from all around the world regarding COVID-19.
The objective is understanding how the pandemic evolved on each country, how the evolution of the virus relates to risk factors identified over the population, development indexes, stringency efficiency and other factors that may be correlated.

Latter on, we will focus on Brazil. Being one of the countries with highest death rates, the idea is comparing how the country performed in the pandemic against the 3 most successful and 3 least successful countries on each continent. Here, we can identify what actions may have helped or hindered the results, how development indexes and median age of those countries may affect the results and see, besides that, what Brazil could've done better.
