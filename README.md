COVID-19 evaluation focused on Brazil.

The main idea of this project is evaluating data from all around the world regarding COVID-19.
The objective is understanding how the pandemic evolved on each country, how the evolution of the virus relates to risk factors identified over the population, development indexes, stringency efficiency and other factors that may be correlated.

Latter on, we will evalate ONU's 4 HDI tiers (Low, Medium, High and Very High human development). Here we will consider the 5 best and 5 worst performing countries to see how countries with different HDI dealed with the pandemic and if there's a correlation between the success of contagion containment and the index itself.
